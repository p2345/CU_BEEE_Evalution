Experiment 1- Design a system for LPG gas burners such that, whenever it is turned on, a green LED starts blinking and if it stays on for more than 2000 ms, instead of the green LED, a Red LED starts blinking.
Circuit Diagram:


Theory-
1. Concepts Used: 
Working of Arduino UNO 
Coding in Arduino IDE and syntax of the same
Working of LEDs (Light emitting diodes) and gas detector
Making connections on a Breadboard.

2. Learning & Observations: 
Use of Arduino board and coding in Arduino IDE: Arduino board is very systematical way to show how the circuit is working. Coding syntax is this is  similar to the coding in C language which we already know. I learnt the  importance of delay function as the micro-controller is  fast and capable.
I observed that there are many other interesting functions we can perform with Arduino like blinking of LED with Gas detector.

3. Problems & Troubleshooting-
I encountered a problem  in making connections on the breadboard and while uploading the code and I rectified by retrying and removing all the errors.
4. Precautions-
Remember to declare all the ports in use in digital input/output in the right way.
Check whether all your wire connections are correct and tight.
Delay gap should be correct for testing the program .

5. Learning Outcomes-
Skills that I have acquired are  knowledge of how to use Arduino UNO with components like LDR to make systems like automatic night lighting
